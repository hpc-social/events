SUMMARY:FOSDEM HPC\, Big Data and Data Science devroom in Brussels\, Belgi
 um hosted by FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the co
 mmunity for the community. The goal is to provide free and open source sof
 tware developers and communities a place to meet to:  get in touch with ot
 her developers and projects\; be informed about the latest developments in
  the free software world\; be informed about the latest developments in th
 e open source world\; attend interesting talks and presentations on variou
 s topics by project leaders and committers\; to promote the development an
 d benefits of free software and open source solutions. Participation and a
 ttendance is totally free\, though the organisers gratefully accept donati
 ons and sponsorship.

CATEGORIES:Conference\,  Community Meeting\,  Talk or Presentation
DESCRIPTION:High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data are two importan
 t approaches to scientific computing. HPC typically deals with smaller\, h
 ighly structured data sets and huge amounts of computation while Big Data\
 , not surprisingly\, deals with gigantic\, unstructured data sets and focu
 ses on the I/O bottlenecks. With the Big Data trend unlocking access to an
  unprecedented amount of data\, Data Science has emerged to tackle the pro
 blem of creating processes and approaches to extracting knowledge or insig
 hts from these data sets. Machine learning and predictive analytics algori
 thms have joined the family of more traditional HPC algorithms and are pus
 hing the requirements of cluster and data scalability.  Free and Open Sour
 ce communities have been the foundation of the HPC and Big Data communitie
 s for some time. In the HPC community\, it should be no surprise that curr
 ently 100% of the Top500 supercomputers in the world run (some variant of)
  Linux. On the Big Data side\, the Hadoop ecosystem has had a tremendous a
 mount of Open Source contributions from a wide range of organizations comi
 ng together under the Apache Software Foundation.  Our goal is to bring th
 e communities together\, share expertise\, learn how we can benefit from e
 ach other's work and foster further joint research and collaboration. We w
 elcome talks about Free and Open Source solutions to the challenges presen
 ted by large scale computing\, data management and data analysis.
